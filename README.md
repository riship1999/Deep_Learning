## Task A: Image & Text Generation using DeepSeek
- Used **DeepSeek Janus Pro** for text-to-image generation.
- Provided an interesting image as input and generated meaningful information.
- Utilized **DeepSeek R1** for text-based conversations and content generation.
- Outputs and implementation details are available in the **Colab notebook**, which has been checked into GitHub.

## Task B: Full-Stack App using Bolt.diy
- Built a **To-Do List App** with priority sorting.
- Used **Bolt.diy** for full-stack development.
- The final application includes features such as task creation, deletion, and priority-based sorting.
- The complete source code is available in the repository.
- A demo video walkthrough is included.

## Task C: Neural Network Classifier using Cursor
- Used **Cursor AI Editor** to generate neural network code for an **MNIST classifier** using Keras.
- Implemented all relevant supporting metrics, including accuracy, loss visualization, and confusion matrix.
- The full implementation follows the methodology discussed in class.
- The process and code walkthrough are available on YouTube.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd [repository_folder]
   ```
2. Follow setup instructions in respective directories (`Task_A`, `Task_B`, etc.).
3. For Colab-based work, open the `.ipynb` files and run the cells.
4. For full-stack apps, install dependencies and run the servers.
   ```bash
   npm install  # If applicable
   python app.py  # If using Flask/Django
   ```
5. For neural network training, execute the `mnist_classifier.py` file.
   ```bash
   python mnist_classifier.py
   ```
6. Check out the YouTube video for a full walkthrough.
